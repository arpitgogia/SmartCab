    "The agent is able to reach the destination more than 25% of the trips while still following all the traffic rules.\n",
    "### ***Q2. Identify and Update State. Justify why you picked these set of states, and how they model the agent and its environment.***\n",
    "The state that I chose is represented by the input parameters, the next waypoint and the deadline. <br>\n",
    "I chose these parameters for my state because it represents the scenario of real life driving to a very good extent. In real life, while driving a cab, one considers oncoming traffic, lights etc. as well as in how much time one has to get there and the proposed route using waypoints. Another factor that I considered while choosing state variables was the availability of these in real life. The state variables that I chose are available through sensors in a self driving car.\n",
