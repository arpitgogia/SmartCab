    "### Implement a basic Learning Agent\n",
    "The basic approach to building the basic Learning Agent was to choose the action with the best possible reward at each stage. So basically I started with a Random behavioural state and if the reward after a particular random action was greater than the previous reward then the algorithm would continue doing that action until the reward decreases in a particular iteration.\n",
